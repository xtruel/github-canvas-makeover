## Roma Matches Auto-Update Feature üèüÔ∏è

This project includes an automated AS Roma fixture update system that fetches match data from API-Football and updates the site automatically.

### Setup Instructions

To enable automatic match updates, you need to add an API key secret to your repository:

1. Get a free API key from [api-football.com](https://api-football.com)
2. Go to your repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add a new repository secret named `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` with your API key as the value

**That's it!** The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Update match data daily at 6:00 AM UTC
- Refresh more frequently (every 30 minutes) during European evening hours (18:00-22:00 UTC)
- Handle rate limiting responsibly to work with free tier API limits
- Commit changes only when new data is available

### Without API Key

The site will build and work perfectly without the API key - it will simply use static placeholder data and gracefully fall back to any available legacy data sources.
